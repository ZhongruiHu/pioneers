"Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi", "800", "The term 'algorithm' is derived from the algorism, the technique of performing arithmetic with Hindu-Arabic numerals developed by al-Khwārizmī. Both 'algorithm' and 'algorism' are derived from the Latinized forms of al-Khwārizmī's name, Algoritmi and Algorismi, respectively.", "Algorithm", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi#Arithmetic"
"John Vincent Atanasoff", 1939, "The Atanasoff–Berry computer (ABC) was the first automatic electronic digital computer. The ABC's priority is debated among historians of computer technology, because it was not programmable, nor Turing-complete.", "Electronic Computer, Computer", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atanasoff%E2%80%93Berry_computer"
"Charles Babbage", "1825", "Invented the Difference Engine, an automatic mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions. It was not programmable, nor Turing-complete..", "Mechanical Computer, Computer", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine"

"John Backus", 1959, "Served on the design committee for ALGOL 60, an incredibly influential programming language which introduced lexical scoping, code blocks and many syntactical elements common today (if, then, while, for, do, begin, end, etc).", "ALGOL, Programming Language", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60"
