  <h2>Mobile detected</h2>
  <p>Whilst <i>The Pioneers</i> does provide limited support for most mobile browsers, I must warn you that the current experience may be less than desirable. Sorry!</p>
  <p>I recommend you switch to a larger screen for the best experience. If you must use mobile, I'd recommend using your device in <strong>landscape</strong> mode.</p>
  <p>I will produce an appropriate mobile adaptation of the web site if there is enough demand.</p>
