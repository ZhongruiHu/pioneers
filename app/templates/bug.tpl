  <h2>Bug / Data error</h2>
  <p>If you've found a bug in the app or, more importantly, you've noticed that PIONEERS is missing data or presenting some one/thing incorrectly, please let me know via <a href="https://github.com/buntine/pioneers/issues/new">a Github issue</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/buntine/pioneers/pulls">pull request</a> on the official repository. You could also send me mail via the email address that is <strong>info</strong> at the website <strong>bunts.io</strong>.</p>
  <p>The data for this website was collected by hand and so any help in improving it would be greatly appreciated!</p>
  <p><i>Note about accuracy</i>: It's always a little risky to "rank" people in terms of their importance. And although I've tried to be fair I feel compelled to declare that this website is intended to celebrate the achievements of the masters of our field and is no way attempting to belittle any one persons effort. It should be assumed that this data set will always be somewhat incomplete <i>and</i> somewhat in accurate.</p>
