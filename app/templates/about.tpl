  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>who</strong> page will present each pioneer and their relative importance, via radius, for the chosen tag(s).</li>
    <li>The <strong>when</strong> page presents a timeline of achievements for the chosen tag(s), color-coded by overall impact.</li>
    <li>The <strong>where</strong> page presents a map of where the pioneers hail from.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>PIONEERS is a pet-project of me, <a href="http://bunts.io/">Andrew Buntine</a>. I'd also like thank <a href="http://melaniehuang.com/">Melanie Huang</a> for the design. All data was collected by hand, including imagery, so if you are the original owner of one of the images presented on this site and would like me to remove it, please contact me.</p>
