## Data

The pioneer data that populates this website was collected via research from many sources across the World Wide Web, rewritten into my own words and reformatted where appropriate. I hereby provide this collated data in CSV format to the community for use in further projects:

If you make something cool, please send me a link. Happy hacking!

## Accuracy / Disclaimer

It's always a little risky to "rank" people in terms of their importance. And although I've tried to be fair I feel compelled to declare that this website is intended to celebrate the achievements of the masters of our field and is no way attempting to belittle any one persons effort relative to anothers. It should be assumed that this data set will always be *somewhat incomplete* and *somewhat inaccurate*.

Contributions and corrections are always more than welcome!
